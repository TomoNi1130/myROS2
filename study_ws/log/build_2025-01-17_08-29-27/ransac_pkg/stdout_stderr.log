[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findinterface_pkg.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "interface_pkg", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "interface_pkg"
  with any of the following names:

    interface_pkgConfig.cmake
    interface_pkg-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "interface_pkg" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "interface_pkg_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "interface_pkg" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
